                    I am an experienced marketing professional with nearly 20 years of experience managing multi-channel campaigns for large
                    financial and insurance corporations. As a member of fast-paced internal marketing teams, I excel at managing
                    the many aspects of projects for my clients - utilizing various marketing and media channels - both tactical
                    and strategic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Clients and vendors I have worked with to date include (but are not limited to) Edward Jones Investments (St. Louis, MO),
                    Keller Williams Realty (Austin, TX), National Association of Realtors (Chicago, IL), Kingsmill/Michelob Ultra
                    Open (Williamsburg, VA), Richmond International Raceway (Richmond, VA)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am highly organized and possess strong project management skills from the traditional to working in Agile Scrum. As such,
                    I am a Certified Scrum Product Owner&reg; as well as a Certified Scrum Master&reg;. While in a previous role,
                    I managed the redesign, development and deployment of two B2B websites. During this time, I was fortunate
                    enough to learn a lot about the backend as well as the front end. I look forward to continuing the journey
                    and growing as a web developer.
